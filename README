Geryon is a small C++ server with a Java-like programming interface.

It offers:
1/ A SQL connection pool (support only for PostgreSQL, for now)
2/ Multiple threading paradigms based on the reactor I/O
3/ A minimal management interface

From the programming point of view:
1/ Familiar Java notions like Servlet, Filter, Application, Session
2/ Each application can 'mount' additional modules (via configuration). These modules are hierarchical.
3/ We intend to use it behind Apache httpd / nginx to create some backbone.js apps. HTML pages, static content and JS should be served by front-end (apache, nginx) while dynamic stuff should be served from behind (reverse proxy).

You have some examples in the test_it and examples directories.

Version 0.1 runs only on Linux; it was tested on both Ubuntu and CentOS, 32 & 64 bytes OS.

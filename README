Geryon is not a monster. It is a small C++ server with a Java-like programming interface.

It offers:
1/ A SQL connection pool (support for PostgreSQL, for now)
2/ Multiple threading paradigms based on the reactor I/O
3/ A minimal management interface

From the programming point of view:
1/ Familiar Java notions like Servlet, Filter, Application, Session
2/ Each application can 'mount' additional modules (via configuration). These modules are hierarchical.
3/ We intend to use it behind Apache httpd / nginx to create some backbone.js apps

You have some examples in the test_it and examples directory.

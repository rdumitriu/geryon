FUNCTIONAL
~~~~~~~~~~

1/ SQL Pools - must
2/ Introspection - buf
3/ Introspection - app ses


STABILITY
~~~~~~~~~

1/ Configuration - clear TODOs
2/ Lots of tests needed


PERFORMANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~

1/ Create direct (new / delete) memory pool
2/ Create thread bound memory pool
3/ Create multiple execution queues (with threads + static atomic integer). 
That should minimize contention on executors
4/ Log should be on a separate thread; this includes the formatting (if possible).
5/ Use hints on http where possible to get the proper buffers. This means that we should implement
a memory pool that offers different-sized buffers
6/ Create real stock answers (unchanged buffers) 
7/ Implement keep-alive
8/ Implement a light-weight connection manager. I do not believe this adds too much to our server, 
I do not need to track the connection all the time to terminate it gracefully. If the comm is broken
so be it!

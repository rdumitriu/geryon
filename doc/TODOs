TODOs
~~~~~~

1/ Lots of tests needed (end to end, we'll buy time, using curl / perl?)



PERFORMANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~

1/ Create direct (new / delete) memory pool
2/ Create thread bound memory pool
3/ Create multiple execution queues (with threads + static atomic integer). 
That should minimize contention on executors
4/ Log should be on a separate thread; this includes the formatting (if possible).
5/ Use hints on http where possible to get the proper buffers. This means that we should implement
a memory pool that offers different-sized buffers
6/ Create real stock answers (unchanged buffers) 
7/ Implement keep-alive

FURTHER MODIFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1/ SQL pools were introduced in a hurry. That needs to be changed, since it's too dependent in many
places of the defines ... We must find some common ground for the sql pools. However, since it's on
server side, we can touch it when we'll add Mysql, or whatever. I may like this direct approach, though
2/ Configuration - clear TODOs and simplify. In the future we may pack more on it

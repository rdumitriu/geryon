FUNCTIONAL
~~~~~~~~~~

1/ Introspection - buf
2/ Introspection - app ses


STABILITY
~~~~~~~~~

1/ Configuration - clear TODOs
2/ Lots of tests needed
3/ SQL pools were introduced in a hurry. That needs to be changed, since it's too dependent in many 
places of the defines ... We must find some common ground for the sql pools. However, since it's on 
server side, we can touch it when we'll add Mysql, or whatever.


PERFORMANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~

1/ Create direct (new / delete) memory pool
2/ Create thread bound memory pool
3/ Create multiple execution queues (with threads + static atomic integer). 
That should minimize contention on executors
4/ Log should be on a separate thread; this includes the formatting (if possible).
5/ Use hints on http where possible to get the proper buffers. This means that we should implement
a memory pool that offers different-sized buffers
6/ Create real stock answers (unchanged buffers) 
7/ Implement keep-alive
